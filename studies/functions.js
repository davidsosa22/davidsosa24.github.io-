// Functions allow us to write  reusable, modular code
//We define a "chunk" of codet hat we can then execute at a later point.

//There is two phases.
 
// 1. First is define 

//function created
function example() {
 //chunk of code in here
}

//2. second is running the function
example();


//In functions we have inputs called parameters and we can specify what the function outputs with the arguments 
//input: what datatype is being passed into this function?
//output: what should this function return
//functions accepts inputs, processes the inputs and returns a new data value

// Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is not true

// Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function 
// and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures.
/** LOOPS:
 * 0. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
 * 1. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
 * 2. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
